# Custom Fedora Silverblue OCI Images

This repository contains Dockerfiles for building OCI images based off of Fedora Silverblue.
These images are meant to be used as workstation OS images.

**I WOULD NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO DIRECTLY USE THESE ON THEIR MACHINES. I MAY CHANGE THINGS SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FUTURE.**
I'd rather advise you to take inspiration from my repo in case you'd want something similar to this for your own machine(s), and then setup an own custom repo or fork this one.

Heavily inspired by [uBlue](https://github.com/ublue-os). I'd encourage to also check them out, they know their ways around this stuff miles better than I do.
